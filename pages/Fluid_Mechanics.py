## Fluid Mechanics

    One of the first things we observe in a fluid is its density. Will the fluid stay above water or below it when 
    is brought together with water ?   
    
    Density of a fluid is defined as the ratio of its mass and volume. However they are other ways of defining densities
    as well like Relative density which tell us whether the fluid is lighter or heavier.
    
    This brings us awareness of the world around us that air is a fluid, lighter than water. Water vapour which 
    compose the clouds are lighter than air.
