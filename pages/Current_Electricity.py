## Experimental Setup to Verify Ohm's Law   

    Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical circuits that states:
    
        V = I * R
        
        where:  
        - V : Voltage across the resistor (in volts, V)  
        - I : Current flowing through the resistor (in amperes, A)  
        - R : Resistance of the resistor (in ohms)

# Questions and Answers

with st.expander("Q 1. Why is it important to connect the voltmeter in parallel and ammeter in series in the circuit"
                 "during the experiment?"):
    st.write("""
            - The voltmeter measures the potential difference across the resistor. 
            - It must be connected in parallel so it measures the voltage drop across the resistor without affecting the
            current flow through it. 
            - Voltmeters have high resistance, minimizing current flow through them. The ammeter measures the total 
            current flowing in the circuit. 
            - Ammeter must be connected in series to ensure the same current flows through both the ammeter and 
            the resistor. 
            - Ammeters have very low resistance to avoid altering the circuit's current.""")

with st.expander("Q 2. If a student plots a graph of voltage V versus current I for a resistor and observes a curve"
                 "instead of a straight line, what might be the reason?"):
    st.write("""
        The curve indicates that Ohmâ€™s Law is not being followed. Possible reasons include:
    
        - Non-ohmic behavior: The resistor may not be an ohmic conductor. Examples include diodes or filament
          bulbs, where resistance changes with temperature or voltage.
             
        - Overheating of the resistor: At higher currents, the resistor might heat up, changing its resistance.
            
        - Faulty apparatus: Errors in the connections, or a malfunctioning resistor, voltmeter, or ammeter,
             can cause deviations.
             
        To address this, ensure the resistor is ohmic, the connections are correct, and the apparatus is functioning
        properly.""")
